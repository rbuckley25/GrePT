# GrePT

The idea for GrePT is a search tool that leverages a model in the backgroud to find specific data such as all images in with cars in a given folder etc.
This is very much a work in progress/learning experience to play with Rust and AI end points.

The basis for the grep tool comes from the tutorials in The Rust Programming Language book which can be found [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html)
